# Album Selector
I wanted to work on this project because I had a simple problem: I had a lot of albums saved to my Spotify account and I didn't want to spend time scrolling through all of them to find something to listen to. So, why not make something that would randomly select something for me?

## Planned Functionality
I want this application to be a single webpage where you click a button (after allowing access to your Spotify account) and the application goes through your saved albums in your library and displays the cover art, title, and artist name. If you don't feel like listening to the given album there will a button to "re-roll" and the application will remember previous albums that have been selected as to not be given to the user multiple times.

## Future Plans
After I've implemented the functionality outlined above, I may implement a way to narrow down the album selection by genre or mood. I may also try to make it so that when you are given an album you feel like listening to you can press a button and your Spotify will start playing said album.
